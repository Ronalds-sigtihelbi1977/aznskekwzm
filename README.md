Just rolled out of the cinema seat after watching Death of a Unicorn, and oh boy, where do I even start? It’s like someone took all the colors of my brain palette and just tossed it on a big dramatic canvas. I mean, unicorns and corporate greed, what a pairing! Exactly what we all needed on this lovely Tuesday evening, right? The whole thing felt like a dream I had after eating too much cheese – strange, vivid, and just a bit unsettling.

Is it me, or did the director just decide halfway through that the plot was kinda optional? One minute it’s all enchanting, and the next it turns into a boardroom battle. Delightful! Who knew unicorns would be the next insider trading scandal? I swear, if I hear the word “synergy” one more time… but there were these moments though. Really vivid, like the light streaming in through dusty old windows, casting shadows just right; it almost got me inspired to redecorate a room or two with moody, brooding themes. Almost.

> And the actors! Gosh, the expressions on those unicorns! It's like they were method acting straight out of a magical meadow while the humans around them just bumbled along. Could someone send a memo to the casting department to chill? I'm half convinced the unicorns were judging us, mere mortals, from their higher plains of existence, or maybe just wondering when the director would yell, Cut!

In that scene where the CEO literally trips over ambition, wow just wow – like, was that supposed to be poignant or comedy gold? Watching it felt kind of like rearranging furniture in a hurricane, thrilling yet slightly pointless. I mean, would download the movie for that scene alone just to let it percolate in my brain for a while.

{
  int magicLevel = 7;
  float stockPrice = 42.0;
  if(magicLevel > stockPrice){
    summonUnicorn();
  }
}

But there it is, the strangeness of a unicorn's shadow still looming over me, even as I step into the harsh neon lights outside the theater. It might take a week to process what I just watched or maybe five minutes, depends on how much ice cream I have. All said and done, if you're into peculiar films that make your brain do cartwheels in slow motion, maybe give it a whirl. Or don't, and arrange your sock drawer instead. Both are equally valid life choices.
